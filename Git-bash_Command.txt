Bash Commands for the Springboot-Buildingblocks Project

1st - Go to the actual folder location where you have the code in your local using the command

cd /d/Java/Springboot_WorkSpace/Udemy_Kalyan_Reddy/springboot-buildingblocks/springboot-buildingblocks

If you want to change the directory from current one to another, first move out from the current one using the command "cd<space>.."

cd ..

This will change to the directory right before
